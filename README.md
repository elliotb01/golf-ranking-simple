# Simple golf ranking system
This simple ranking algorithm ranks each player based on the number of appearances on runner up or winning positions. However this is not an accurate ranking algorithm on who is considered the best. More who has won the most amount of times.

## How to use
Download file from repository named GolfData.ipynb and run the main code block. It will then print out the top 5 players with their individual scores along with the top 2 golfers and the years they either won or were runners up.
